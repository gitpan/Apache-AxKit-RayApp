			Apache::AxKit::RayApp
		-------------------------------------

This is a framework for running applications in mod_perl/AxKit
environment. These application only return Perl data, nothing else.
This Perl data is then inserted into structural XML description,
forming XML output. This output is further processed by standard
XML transformations (like XSLT) to deliver desired format, layout
and design.

So your Perl application only does the actions like fiddling with
database records and it doesn't have to deal with HTML or XML markup.

Installation:
